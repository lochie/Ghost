	Ghost is an interactive music piece conceptualized by Andrew Huang.

	An ever-growing number of YouTube videos (nicknamed "Ghosts") can be played in any combination,
	and even started at completely different times, while always creating a harmonious listening experience.

	Ghost was selected by panelists and a public vote as the winner of the American Express Room For Thought program,
	giving Huang the opportunity to work with Metric singer Emily Haines to develop the piece as an art installation. 

	The first installation involved a series of enormous touch screens through which the public
	could interact with Ghost's musical performances in a captivating new way, and record their creations to take home.
	This was showcased in November 2011 at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto.

	The flexibility and wide-reaching appeal of the concept allows for it to be explored in many different ways;
	currently a second live installation is in planning stages, and there is the possibility of a mobile app being developed.
	You've landed on the page for Ghost's online interface, so you can experience it right here. Enjoy!
